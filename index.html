    <p> My name is Anthony Ochoa I am from Wichita, Kansas. I joined the United States Navy right out of highschool.
      While
      I was in the Navy I was a Master At Arms, essentially Base Police. When I left the Military I went to school at
      Everett Community College where I graduated with an Associates in English. I decided that I wanted to follow a
      passion of mine and become a writer. While I began writing my first book. I continued in the field of Security
      where
      I have been the site Supervisor for the Entire Boeing Everett plant, and am currently a Site Supervisor for
      Facebook. I am Married and have an 8 month old daughter, her name is Ainsley. I have been married for 3 years now
      and currently live in Lake
      Stevens.
      I am incredibly excited to start my journey in Coding and Software Development, and I am looking forward to
      working with all of you!

      Thank you for coming to my Ochie Talk.
